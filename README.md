# Blockchain-powered Decentralized Autonomous Sustainable Fashion Supply Chain

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized platform for tracking and verifying sustainable practices in the fashion industry. It leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and accountability throughout the fashion supply chain. The platform includes features for managing garment lifecycles, enforcing fair labor practices, incentivizing sustainable choices, creating a marketplace for upcycled fashion, and integrating AR technology for virtual try-ons.

## Features

1. Garment Lifecycle NFTs
    - Represent the complete lifecycle of garments from raw materials to consumer
    - Track sustainability scores and ownership history

2. Fair Labor Practices
    - Smart contracts for enforcing fair labor practices and payments
    - Manufacturer compliance tracking and worker payment records

3. Sustainability Incentives
    - Tokenized rewards for consumers choosing sustainable fashion options
    - Point system for eco-friendly actions and purchases

4. Upcycled Fashion Marketplace
    - Decentralized marketplace for buying and selling upcycled and recycled fashion items
    - Secure and transparent transactions using smart contracts

5. AR Integration for Virtual Try-ons
    - Integration with Augmented Reality (AR) for virtual garment try-ons
    - Reduced returns through improved pre-purchase visualization
